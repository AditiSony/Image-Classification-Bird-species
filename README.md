# Multiclass Image Classification-Bird-species
Welcome to my project on Multiclass Image Classification using pre-trained Resnet50 model on imagenet dataset with additional layers!

Datafiles can be obtained from Kaggle page at- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species

All work is done in Python using Jupyter notebook. Please change the filepath to your local system where datafiles are stored and make sure that you have all the required libraries installed before running the code file.

Unfortunately the saved pre-trained model with weights could not be uploaded on Github due to file size constarint, however you can run the code and train model in your local environment or on google colab.
